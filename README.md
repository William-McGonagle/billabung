## What is this horrible thing?
It is a replica of one of the old websites that could check if people are compatible. Think love calculator. Instead... this app works by comparing two people's faces to one another. It takes everything bad about love and crushes it into a 9 KB monstrosity! And, on top of that, it is run completely on the client side. Meaning that you don't have to edit your own server files or anything like that.
